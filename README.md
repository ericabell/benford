# Benford's Law

Simple website to support uploading a file for visualizing Benford's Law.

In addition to a simple histogram showing the distribution of leading digits from numbers in the file, a distribution of Benford's Law is presented. Using a simple Chi-Squared test, the code determines if there is sufficient evidence to suggest that the file's data is not consistent with Benford's Law. Chi-Squared seems to be the appropriate hypthesis test, although for small samples, the Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov test might be more appropriate.

The app is fairly permissive in terms of extracting numbers from the file that has been uploaded. The census example file seemed to have a bit of structure, but I didn't want to restrict the app to that fixed format.
